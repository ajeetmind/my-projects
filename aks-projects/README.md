Infrastructure:
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): Since Ghost is containerizable, AKS is ideal for scaling on demand. We'll deploy Ghost in a multi-container pod setup.
Azure Traffic Manager: This will distribute the incoming traffic across multiple AKS clusters possibly in different regions ensuring high availability.
To achieve a multi-regional setup, we would typically deploy multiple AKS clusters in different regions and use Azure Traffic Manager or Azure Front Door to distribute the traffic.


Deployment and CI/CD:
Azure DevOps: To automate build and deployment processes. Allows DevOps teams to release multiple times a day without downtime.
Database:
Azure Database for MySQL: A fully managed MySQL service with built-in high availability and automated backups.
Serverless:
Azure Functions: For deleting all the blog posts.
Observability and Monitoring:
Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics: To provide observability.
Azure Security Center: For security insights.
Disaster Recovery:
Azure Site Recovery: For quick recovery in case of regional failures.

# Implementation
setup AKS Cluster:
Create a multi-regional AKS cluster to ensure high availability.
Set up auto-scaling in AKS to handle traffic spikes.
Ghost Deployment on AKS:
Containerize the Ghost blogging platform.
Deploy Ghost containers into the AKS cluster using Helm charts or K8s manifests.
Set up Azure DevOps for CI/CD:
Integrate the Ghost repository with Azure DevOps.
Set up build and release pipelines.
Database Configuration:
Set up Azure Database for MySQL.
Connect Ghost to the MySQL instance.
Azure Traffic Manager Configuration:
Set up Azure Traffic Manager to distribute traffic among AKS clusters.
Serverless function using Azure Functions:
Write a function to interface with the Ghost API to delete all blog posts.
Trigger can be set based on HTTP requests.
Monitoring and Observability:
Integrate Azure Monitor and Log Analytics with AKS for logging and monitoring.
Enable Azure Security Center for security recommendations.
Disaster Recovery:
Use Azure Site Recovery services.

## Improvement

## terraform remote state management
Sharing: By keeping the Terraform state in a shared location, multiple users can work with the same infrastructure.
Locking: In a team setting, state locking ensures that multiple users don't modify the same infrastructure at the same time.
Consistency: It keeps state out of your local machine, ensuring everyone is working off the same state.
